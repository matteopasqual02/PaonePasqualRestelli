\section{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Number of concurrent Users}: According to recent research, websites with a similar goal of S\&C, have about 1.8 million Users. We want our website to attract at least 25\% of those Users, which means S\&C should be able to handle up to 500,000 Users simultaneously. This is important for making sure our website works well for a good number of people, giving them a smooth and enjoyable 
    experience.

    \item \textbf{Data storage}: S\&C needs to save and manage all the details about both STs and COMs which are a large amount of data. Additionally, it has to store information about all the Interviews, complaints, problems, data analytics, and other information.

    \item \textbf{Time response}: Every operation that is directly executed by S\&C, i.e. register, login, upload, and evaluate, should be in the domain of milliseconds. 

    \item \textbf{Availability}: S\&C should have high availability, aiming 24h 7 on 7. This is essential to provide continuous access to users without unexpected interruptions, ensuring they can reliably access services whenever needed. Techniques such as load balancing, failover systems, and regular backups should be implemented to meet this requirement.
