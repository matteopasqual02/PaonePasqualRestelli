\chapter{Specific Requirements}
This section is devoted to a specific description of every kind of requirement the system has to deal with to achieve all the functionalities described.

\section{External Interface Requirements}
\subsection{User Interfaces}
The Students\&Companies's User interface will be a website, developed to be used
both by STs and COMs, available to everybody who has a device with an Internet Browser
and a reliable Internet connection.

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The system will be accessible from every device with an Internet Browser to access the
website and a reliable Internet connection.  The User is free to choose his device like a computer, a tablet, or a smartphone.

\subsection{Software Interfaces}
The system requires an API to send emails. These emails can be for instance account 2FA confirmation or general notification by email

\section{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Number of concurrent Users}: According to recent research, websites with a similar goal of S\&C, have about 1.8 million Users. We want our website to attract at least 25\% of those Users, which means S\&C should be able to handle up to 500,000 Users simultaneously. This is important for making sure our website works well for a good number of people, giving them a smooth and enjoyable 
    experience.

    \item \textbf{Data storage}: S\&C needs to save and manage all the details about both STs and COMs which are a large amount of data. Additionally, it has to store information about all the Interviews, complaints, problems, data analytics, and other information.

    \item \textbf{Time response}: Every operation that is directly executed by S\&C, i.e. register, login, upload, and evaluate, should be in the domain of milliseconds. 

    \item \textbf{Availability}: S\&C should have high availability, aiming 24h 7 on 7. This is essential to provide continuous access to users without unexpected interruptions, ensuring they can reliably access services whenever needed. Techniques such as load balancing, failover systems, and regular backups should be implemented to meet this requirement.
