\section{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Number of concurrent Users}: According to recent research, websites with similar goals as S\&C have approximately 1.8 million users. Our target is to attract at least 25\% of this user base, which means that S\&C should be capable of handling up to 500,000 concurrent users. This is crucial to ensure the platform operates efficiently and provides a seamless, enjoyable experience for a substantial number of users.

    \item \textbf{Data storage}: The S\&C platform needs to store and manage extensive data related to both STs and COMs. Additionally, it must handle data pertaining to interviews, complaints, issues, data analytics, and other critical information. This requires robust data storage solutions that ensure data integrity, security, and scalability.

    \item \textbf{Time response}: All operations directly executed by S\&C, such as user registration, login, file upload, and evaluation, should have response times within the range of milliseconds. This quick response time is essential to deliver a smooth user experience and maintain user satisfaction. 
   
\end{itemize}


\section{Design Constraints}
\subsection{Standards Compliance}
The S\&C platform is designed to strictly follow several standards to ensure quality, security, and interoperability. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{HTTPS Protocol}: The platform implements the HTTPS protocol according to the cryptographic standards established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), ensuring secure communication between users and the platform.

    \item \textbf{Accessibility Stand}: S\&C complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure that the platform is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

    \item \textbf{Security Standards}: The platform follows security best practices as defined by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). This includes password storage encryption using HASH512 + Salt, SSL certificates, and end-to-end communication encryption to protect user data.

    \item \textbf{API Standard}:  The platform uses open standards for API design, such as RESTful APIs, and adheres to specifications like OpenAPI (Swagger) to ensure smooth integration with other systems.

    \item \textbf{Coding Standards}: S\&C follows universally accepted coding guidelines for the primary programming languages used in system development (e.g., Python, Java). This includes adherence to coding conventions such as PEP 8 for Python and Java Coding Conventions for Java.

    \item \textbf{Compliance and Privacy}: The platform complies with privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European citizens, ensuring the protection of user privacy and data rights.
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Limitations}

To access the S\&C platform, both students and companies must have an electronic device, such as a computer, tablet, or smartphone, with a reliable internet connection. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{STs}: Students need a device that allows them to access the platform, upload applications, attend interviews, and perform other required activities. They must also have the ability to upload and download files, such as resumes or application documents.

    \item \textbf{COMs}: Companies also need a device with internet access to view applications, schedule interviews, and manage internship postings.
\end{itemize}

Both types of users must have devices that enable them to receive notifications from the platform, ensuring they stay informed about important updates and actions required. The devices should be able to support modern web browsers to access the S\&C platform effectively.


\section{Software System Attributes}
\subsection{Reliability}

The S\&C platform does not manage critical operations. If an operation fails, it can be re-executed without any significant consequences. For example, if the curriculum upload fails, students can simply re-upload it without any issues. Given this non-critical nature, it is reasonable to permit a failure rate of around 1\%, as it does not adversely impact the overall user experience or platform functionality.
 
\subsection{Availability}

The S\&C platform should have high availability, aiming for 24/7 uptime. This is essential to provide continuous access to users without unexpected interruptions, ensuring they can reliably access services whenever needed.

To achieve this, techniques such as load balancing to distribute traffic evenly, failover systems to switch to backup resources during outages, and regular data backups to protect against data loss should be implemented. These measures help maintain seamless operation and ensure that the platform remains robust and dependable at all times.

\subsection{Securuty}

Communication between the user and the S\&C platform is encrypted to avoid data breaches, and unauthorized access, and to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information shared on the platform.

Furthermore, users must only be able to perform operations that they are authorized to do. For example, a student must not be able to publish an internship, as this function should be restricted to users with specific permissions, such as platform administrators or authorized representatives. Proper access controls and role-based permissions must be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions within the platform
 
\subsection{Maintainability}

The system should be divided into scalable and reusable modules, making it easier to maintain and replace components in case of failure. This modular approach enhances the platform's flexibility and simplifies the process of updating or scaling specific parts without affecting the entire system. 

Ordinary maintenance, including bug fixes and improvements, will be scheduled during nighttime hours when user traffic is minimal to minimize disruption and maintain a smooth user experience. This strategy ensures that the system remains reliable and maintainable while supporting continuous service improvements.

\subsection{Portability}

The S\&C platform does not require any specific hardware or software and must be accessible from any operating system with a modern web browser. This ensures broad compatibility and ease of use for all users. Additionally, a mobile application can be developed to allow users to view the state of battles and other platform activities. Since the mobile app does not require any specialized functions, a non-native approach can be used. This makes it feasible to leverage cross-platform development tools, which can accelerate the development process and reduce the resources needed for maintaining separate codebases for different platforms.
