\chapter{Formal Analysis using Alloy}
This section provides a formal specification of the entire model using the Alloy language. We will use Alloy 6 to describe entities and relationships in systems. We choose Alloy 6 because is suited for modeling and analyzing the properties of software systems to ensure correctness and consistency.

\section{ Models}
\subsection{Static Analysis}
\textbf{[MS1]} The model shows the basic scenario where one student is applying for an internship at a company with pending status and an in-progress interview.
\begin{lstlisting}
//one student and one company
pred oneStudentOneCompanyOneInternship {
    #Student = 1
    #Company = 1
    #Internship = 1
}
run oneStudentOneCompanyOneInternship for 2
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{ \#6:Instance found oneStudentOneCompanyOneInternship is consistent.}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{RASD//Images/1st1com.png}
    \caption{1 Student, 1 Company, 1 Internship}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\textbf{[MS2]} The model shows a scenario where two students are applying for an internship at a company with pending status and an in-progress interview.
\begin{lstlisting}
//two students and one company
pred twoStudentOneCompanyOneInternship {
    #Student = 2
    #Company = 1
    #Internship = 1
}
run twoStudentOneCompanyOneInternship for 3
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{ \#7:Instance found twoStudentOneCompanyOneInternship is consistent.}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{RASD//Images/2st1com.png}
    \caption{2 Student, 1 Company, 1 Internship}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\textbf{[MS3]} The model shows a scenario where one student is applying for three internships 2 at company A and one at company B with pending status and an in-progress interview.
\begin{lstlisting}
//one student and one two companies
pred oneStudentTwoCompanyThreeInternship {
    #Student = 1
    #Company = 2
    #Internship = 3
}
run oneStudentTwoCompanyThreeInternship for 3 
\end{lstlisting}
{ \#8:Instance found oneStudentTwoCompanyThreeInternship is consistent.}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{RASD//Images/1st2com.png}
    \caption{1 Student, 1 Company, 3 Application}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{1 Student, 1 Company, 3 Application - zoom on the relations}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dynamic Analysis}
\textbf{[MD1]}The model shows the basic scenario where one student applies for an internship
at a company. The dynamic analysis shows how the positive interview status influences the application outcome.

If InProgress $=>$ Passed then Pending $=>$ Accepted
\begin{lstlisting}
//passed interview
pred interviewPassed[ap:Application, s:Student, c:Company]{
	ap.interviews.outcome = InProgress ; 
	ap.interviews.outcome = Passed
	#Student = 1
    	#Company = 1
    	#Internship = 1
}
run interviewPassed for 2  
\end{lstlisting}
{ \#9:Instance found interviewPassed is consistent.}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{RASD//Images/passed.png}
    \caption{Passed inteview}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\textbf{[MD2]}The model shows the basic scenario where one student applies for an internship
at a company. The dynamic analysis shows how the negative interview status influences the application outcome.

If InProgress $=>$ Failed then Pending $=>$ Rejected
\begin{lstlisting}

//failed interview
pred interviewRejected[ar:Application, s:Student, c:Company]{
	ar.interviews.outcome = InProgress ; 
	ar.interviews.outcome = Failed
	#Student = 1
    	#Company = 1
    	#Internship = 1
}
run interviewRejected for 2 
\end{lstlisting}
{ \#10:Instance found interviewRejected is consistent.}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{RASD//Images/failed.png}
    \caption{Failed interview}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

    		u1.email != u2.email and  
		u1.otherInformation != u2.otherInformation
	//role
    	all s: Student | one u: User | u.role = s
    	all c: Company | one u: User | u.role = c
}
check VerifyUserStructure
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{\#1: VerifyUserStructure may be valid.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item An application can only be associated with a student
    \item An application can only be associated with a Intenship
    \item An internship can only be associated with a Company
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
//Assertion to verify DoubleArrowConstraint
assert VerifyDoubleAssociation {
	//An application can only be associated with a student
    	all a: Application | one s: Student | 
    	s in a.submittedBy and a in s.applications and
    	s.applications.submittedBy=s
    	//An application can only be associated with a Intenship

    	c in i.postedBy and i in c.postings and 
    	c.postings.postedBy = c  
}
check VerifyDoubleAssociation
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{\#2: VerifyDoubleAssociation may be valid.}


\textbf{[A3]} Assertion to verify all Internship application structure
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unique Description, CV, and Interview 
    \item Unique Application
    \item A student can make only an application for one internship
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
// Assertion to verify all Internship application structure
assert VerifyInternshipStructures {
	//Unique Description, CV, and Interview 
    	all i1, i2: Internship | i1 != i2 implies 
		i1.description != i2.description
    	all dd: Description | one ii:Internship |

\begin{itemize}
    \item are carried by the same company
    \item are carried by the same student
\end{itemize}
Therefore meetings have a schedule if they are submitted by a student
\begin{lstlisting}
//Two meetings cannot be in the same day if:
assert VerifyInterviewStructures {
	all ss1,ss2: Student | all cc1,cc2: Company |
   	all a1,a2: Application | a1!=a2 and
		//are carried by the same company
   		((ss1 in a1.submittedBy and 
		   ss2 in a2.submittedBy and
   		   cc1 in a1.relatedTo.postedBy and
		   cc1 in a1.relatedTo.postedBy)
   	or
		//are carried by the same student
   		 (ss1 in a1.submittedBy and 
		  ss1 in a2.submittedBy and
   		  cc1 in a1.relatedTo.postedBy and 
		  cc2 in a1.relatedTo.postedBy))
   	implies a1.interviews.schedule != a2.interviews.schedule
  	//meetings have a schedule if a student submits them
   	all a: Application | a.interviews.schedule != none 
   		 implies a.submittedBy in Student
}
check VerifyInternshipStructures
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{\#4: VerifyInterviewStructures may be valid}

\textbf{[A5]} Assertion to verify if the interview process is correctly related to the application process. Three cases are considered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Failed $=>$ Rejected
    \item Passed $=>$ Accepted
    \item InProgress $=>$ Pending
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
//Check interview process
assert InterviewProcess{
    all a: Application | 
	//Failed => Rejected
        some i: a.interviews | i.outcome = Failed 
		implies a.status = Rejected
	and 
	//Passed => Accepted
        some i: a.interviews | i.outcome = Passed 
		implies a.status = Accepted
	and
	//InProgress => Pending
        some i: a.interviews | i.outcome = InProgress 
		implies a.status = Pending
}
check InterviewProcess
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{\#5: InterviewProcess may be valid}
