\chapter{Formal Analysis using Alloy}
This section provides a formal specification of the entire model using the Alloy language. We will use Alloy 6 to describe entities and relationships in systems. We choose Alloy 6 because is suited for modeling and analyzing the properties of software systems to ensure correctness and consistency.

\section{ Models}
\subsection{Static Analysis}
\textbf{[MS1]} The model shows the basic scenario where one student is applying for an internship at a company with pending status and an in-progress interview.
\begin{lstlisting}
run {} for 2 but 
exactly 1 Student, exactly 1 Company, exactly 1  Internship
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{RASD//Images/1st1com.png}
    \caption{1 Student, 1 Company, 1 Internship}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\textbf{[MS1]} The model shows a scenario where two students are applying for an internship at a company with pending status and an in-progress interview.
\begin{lstlisting}
run {} for 3 but 
exactly 2 Student, exactly 1 Company, exactly 1  Internship
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{RASD//Images/2st1com.png}
    \caption{2 Student, 1 Company, 1 Internship}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\textbf{[MS3]} The model shows a scenario where one student is applying for three internships 2 at company A and one at company B with pending status and an in-progress interview.
\begin{lstlisting}
run {} for 3 but 
exactly 1 Student, exactly 1 Company, exactly 3 Internship
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[H]

\section{ Assertions}
\textbf{[A1]} Assertion to verify the correctness of the user structure as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No Users will have the same email or the Personal info
    \item Each role can only be associated with one User
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
// Assertion to verify the correctness of the user structure as:
assert VerifyUserStructure{
    all u1, u2: User | u1 != u2 implies 
    u1.email != u2.email and  u1.otherInformation != u2.otherInformation
    all s: Student | one u: User | u.role = s
    all c: Company | one u: User | u.role = c
}
check VerifyUserStructure
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{\#1: VerifyUserStructure may be valid.}


\textbf{[A2]} Assertion to verify DoubleArrowConstraint:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An application can only be associated with a student
    \item An application can only be associated with a Intenship
    \item An internship can only be associated with a Company
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
//Assertion to verify DoubleArrowConstraint
assert VerifyDoubleAssociation {
    //An application can only be associated with a student
    all a: Application | one s: Student | 
    s in a.submittedBy and a in s.applications and
    s.applications.submittedBy=s
    //An application can only be associated with an Internship
    all a: Application | one i: Internship | 
    a in i.applicants and  i in a.relatedTo and
    i.applicants.relatedTo = i
    //An internship can only be associated with a Company
    all  i:Internship | one c: Company | 
    c in i.postedBy and i in c.postings and 
    c.postings.postedBy = c  
}
check VerifyDoubleAssociation
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{\#2: VerifyDoubleAssociation may be valid.}


\textbf{[A3]} Assertion to verify all Internship application structure
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unique Description, CV, and Interview 
    \item Unique Application
    \item A student can make only an application for one internship
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
// Assertion to verify all Internship application structure
assert VerifyInternshipStructures {
    //Unique Description, CV, and Interview 
    all i1, i2: Internship | i1 != i2 implies  i1.description != i2.description
    all dd: Description | one ii:Internship | dd in ii.description
    all s1,s2: Student| s1 != s2 implies s1.cv != s2.cv
    all ccvv:CV | one ss: Student |  ccvv in ss.cv
    all a1,a2: Application | a1!=a2 implies a1.interviews != a2.interviews
    all i: Interview | one a: Application | i in a.interviews
    //Unique Application
    all i1, i2: Internship | i1 != i2 implies 
    #(i1.applicants & i2.applicants) <= 0
    all c1, c2: Company | c1 != c2 implies 
    #(c1.postings & c2.postings) <= 0
    all s1,s2: Student | s1 !=s2 implies 
    #(s1.applications & s2.applications) <=0
    // A student can make only an application for one internship
    all s: Student | all i: Internship | 
    #(s.applications & i.applicants) <= 1
}
check VerifyInternshipStructures
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{\#3: VerifyInternshipStructures may be valid}


\textbf{[A4]} Assertion to verify all Internship meeting schedules. Two meetings cannot be on the same day if:
\begin{itemize}
    \item are carried by the same company
    \item are carried by the same student
\end{itemize}
Therefore meetings have a schedule if they are submitted by a student
\begin{lstlisting}
//Two meetings cannot be in the same day if:
assert VerifyInterviewStructures {
   all ss1,ss2: Student | all cc1,cc2: Company |
   all a1,a2: Application | a1!=a2 and
   //are carried by the same company
   ((ss1 in a1.submittedBy and ss2 in a2.submittedBy and
   cc1 in a1.relatedTo.postedBy and cc1 in a1.relatedTo.postedBy)
   or
   //are carried by the same student
   (ss1 in a1.submittedBy and ss1 in a2.submittedBy and
   cc1 in a1.relatedTo.postedBy and cc2 in a1.relatedTo.postedBy))
   implies a1.interviews.schedule != a2.interviews.schedule
   //meetings have a schedule if they are submitted by a student
   all a: Application | a.interviews.schedule != none 
   implies a.submittedBy in Student
}
check VerifyInternshipStructures
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{\#4: VerifyInterviewStructures may be valid}
