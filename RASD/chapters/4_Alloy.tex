\chapter{Formal Analysis using Alloy}
This section provides a formal specification of the entire model using the Alloy language. We will use Alloy 6 to describe entities and relationships in systems. We choose Alloy 6 because is suited for modeling and analyzing the properties of software systems to ensure correctness and consistency.

\section{ Models}
\subsection{Static Analysis}
\textbf{[MS1]} The model shows the basic scenario where one student is applying for an internship at a company with pending status and an in-progress interview.
\begin{lstlisting}
run {} for 2 but exactly 1 Student, exactly 1 Company, exactly 1  Internship
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{RASD//Images/1st1com.png}
    \caption{1 Student, 1 Company, 1 Internship}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\textbf{[MS1]} The model shows a scenario where two students are applying for an internship at a company with pending status and an in-progress interview.
\begin{lstlisting}
run {} for 3 but exactly 2 Student, exactly 1 Company, exactly 1  Internship
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{RASD//Images/2st1com.png}
    \caption{2 Student, 1 Company, 1 Internship}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\textbf{[MS3]} The model shows a scenario where one student is applying for three internships 2 at company A and one at company B with pending status and an in-progress interview.
\begin{lstlisting}
run {} for 3 but exactly 1 Student, exactly 1 Company, exactly 3 Application
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{RASD//Images/1st2com.png}
    \caption{1 Student, 1 Company, 3 Application}

\section{ Assertions}
\textbf{[A1]} Assertion to verify the correctness of the user structure as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No Users will have the same email or the Personal info
    \item Each role can only be associated with one User
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
//Assertion to verify the correctness of the user structure as:
assert VerifyUserStructure{
    all u1, u2: User | u1 != u2 implies 
    u1.email != u2.email and  u1.otherInformation != u2.otherInformation
    all s: Student | one u: User | u.role = s
    all c: Company | one u: User | u.role = c
}
check VerifyUserStructure
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{\#1: VerifyUserStructure may be valid.}

\textbf{[A2]} Assertion to verify DoubleArrowConstraint:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An interview can only be associated with an application
    \item An application can only be associated with a student
    \item An application can only be associated with a Intenship
    \item An internship can only be associated with a Company
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
//Assertion to verify DoubleArrowConstraint
assert VerifyDoubleAssociation {
    all i: Interview | one a: Application | 
    i in a.interviews
    all a: Application | one s: Student | 
    s in a.submittedBy and a in s.applications and
    s.applications.submittedBy=s
    all a: Application | one i: Internship |

    i.applicants.relatedTo = i

    c in i.postedBy and i in c.postings and 
    c.postings.postedBy = c

check VerifyDoubleAssociation
\end{lstlisting}
\textit{\#2: VerifyDoubleAssociation may be valid.}

\textbf{[A3]} Assertion to verify all Internship application structure
\begin{itemize}
    \item Students can make only one application for each internship
    \item All applications are related to valid posted internships
    \item A company can't publish two equal internships 
    \item All scheduled interviews are actually submitted
    \item Two students cannot have the same application
    \item meetings company side
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
// Assertion to verify all Internship application structure
assert VerifyInternshipStructures {
    all s: Student | all i: Internship | 
    #(s.applications & i.applicants) <= 1
    all a: Application | a.relatedTo.postedBy in Company
    all i1, i2: Internship | i1 != i2 implies i1.description != i2.description
