\chapter{Overall Description}
This section is devoted to an overall description of every part of the system.

\section{Product Perspective}
\subsection{Scenarios}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{A student creates an account}

    Mario Rossi, a university student eager to participate in an internship, is unsure of how to directly contact companies. 
    
    After learning about Students\&Companies, he decides to explore the platform and create an account. Searching for the site in his browser, Mario arrives at a login page, where he sees an option to create a new account if he is not yet registered. He clicks on this option and follows the account creation steps: entering his email, first name, last name, and date of birth.
    
    Upon completing these basic details, Mario is presented with additional options to enhance his profile, such as uploading a CV and adding a brief personal description. However, he decides to skip this step for now, intending to add these details later, as he is currently focused on just exploring what the platform looks like.
    \item \textbf{A student uploads their CV}

    After exploring the site and deciding he would like to be contacted by companies, Mario decides it’s time to enhance his profile by uploading his CV. To do this, he follows a series of steps:

    First, Mario clicks on his profile to access his personal information. Within his profile, he finds a button labeled "Add your CV" and selects it. This action opens his computer's file browser, where he locates his CV and clicks "Upload." 
    
    Once the file is uploaded, Mario clicks "Publish," making his CV visible to anyone who views his profile.

    This update is also noted by the platform, which analyzes the information within his CV. Based on this analysis, the platform notifies relevant companies who may be searching for profiles similar to Mario's, informing them of the availability of a new candidate.
    \item \textbf{A company advertizes their internship}
    
    TechSolutions, a company seeking interns for a new project, is already familiar with Students\&Companies and has an active account on the platform.
    
    To advertise their open internship position, they navigate to their company profile and select the "Add a new project description" button. This opens a page where they can enter a detailed description of the job responsibilities and the type of student profile they are seeking. 
    
    Once they have completed the description, they click "Publish," making the internship opportunity visible to all visitors to their profile.

    The platform then analyzes this new project listing and notifies students whose profiles match the requirements for the position. 
    
    
    Additionally, students visiting the profile will now be able to click an "Apply" button next to the project description to submit their applications directly, even if they have not received a notification from the system.
    \item \textbf{A student accepts a recomendation}

    Mario, a student with a profile and CV on Students\&Companies, receives a recommendation email from the platform, notifying him of an internship opportunity at a company that aligns with his interests.
   
    In this email, Mario has the option to click on a "See Recommendation" button, which redirects him to his profile. There, he finds a new message containing a link to the company’s account.

    Mario reviews the company’s profile and examines the project that the platform has recommended to him. If he finds it appealing, he can return to the message on his profile and click the "Accept Recommendation" button.

    This action is then flagged by the system to the company, allowing them to contact Mario directly through the platform to coordinate the next steps in the selection process.
    \item \textbf{A company uses the system to manage the interview}

    TechSolutions, having established contact with student Mario Rossi via Students\&Companies, begins the preselection process facilitated by the platform.

    The first step offered by Students\&Companies is for the company to set up a structured questionnaire through Microsoft Forms, featuring predefined questions that Mario must answer. This allows the company to gain a clearer understanding of Mario’s interests, skills, and suitability for the role. If TechSolutions finds his responses satisfactory, they will proceed to the next stage of the interview process; otherwise, they will inform Mario that he has been excluded from further consideration.

    Should they decide to proceed, TechSolutions can initiate a direct chat with Mario to arrange an interview. The interview can be held in person if Mario is able to travel to the location, or via video call if he is unable to attend in person.

    During the interview itself, the company may choose to use additional tools provided by Students\&Companies, such as a shared digital whiteboard for collaborative problem-solving, the ability to share relevant files or documents in real-time, or access to preloaded questions or skills assessments within the system. These tools can facilitate a more interactive and efficient interview experience.

    \item \textbf{A company uses the system to finalize the selection}

    \item \textbf{Students are asked to provide feedback and suggestions}

    \item \textbf{Companies recieve a suggestion on how to make their project description more appealing}

    \item \textbf{A student makes a complaint}

    \item \textbf{A university monitors the situation of an internship}

    \item \textbf{A university handles a complaint}
\end{enumerate}

\section{User charatteristic}

Università??

There are two types of registered users in S\&C: Students (STs) and Companies (COMs). Each user type has distinct characteristics and roles within the platform:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{STs}: Students use S\&C to find a company offering internships. To access the platform, they must have a device with an internet connection and an account that includes their email and personal data. Once registered, students can browse available internships, apply for them, and participate in interviews with 
    companies

    \item \textbf{COMs}:  Companies join S\&C to find students suitable for internships. To use the platform, they need a device with an internet connection and an account that includes their email and company information. Through S\&C, companies can view student applications, schedule interviews, and select candidates for internships.
\end{itemize}

Both STs and COMs must register with the platform to access its services, enabling seamless communication between students seeking internships and companies offering opportunities.
