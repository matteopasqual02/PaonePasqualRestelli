\section{User charatteristic}

Universit√†??

There are two types of registered users in S\&C: Students (STs) and Companies (COMs). Each user type has distinct characteristics and roles within the platform:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{STs}: Students use S\&C to find a company offering internships. To access the platform, they must have a device with an internet connection and an account that includes their email and personal data. Once registered, students can browse available internships, apply for them, and participate in interviews with 
    companies

    \item \textbf{COMs}:  Companies join S\&C to find students suitable for internships. To use the platform, they need a device with an internet connection and an account that includes their email and company information. Through S\&C, companies can view student applications, schedule interviews, and select candidates for internships.
\end{itemize}

Both STs and COMs must register with the platform to access its services, enabling seamless communication between students seeking internships and companies offering opportunities.
