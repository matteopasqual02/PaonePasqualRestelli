\section{User charatteristic}
There are two types of registered Users in S\&C: Students (STs) and Companies (COMs).
Here there is a brief explanation of their main characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{STs}: Students use S\&C to find a Company to find an internship. 
    They need to have a device with an internet connection
    and an account (email and personal data) to have access to  S\&C,
    in which they can apply and attend interviews
    
    \item \textbf{COMs}: Companies join S\&C, where they can find students for an internship.
    They need to have a device with an internet connection
    and an account (email and company data) to have access to  S\&C,
    in which they can watch applications and make interviews
    
\end{itemize}
