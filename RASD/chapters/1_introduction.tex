\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
As the demand for skilled interns in various industries continues to rise, providing students with relevant internship opportunities is essential for their professional growth. 
Traditionally, students often struggle to find internships that match their skills, experiences, and career aspirations, while companies face challenges in sourcing qualified candidates. 
Students\&Companies (S\&C) aims to bridge this gap by creating a dynamic platform that helps the matching of university students with companies offering internships tailored to their profiles.

S\&C provides a unified framework for students to search for internships, allowing them to showcase their CVs and preferences. 
Companies can advertise their internship opportunities, detailing the required skills, tasks, and benefits offered.
The platform employs sophisticated recommendation mechanisms, utilizing keyword searches and statistical analyses to enhance the matching process, thereby ensuring a better fit between students and internships.
Furthermore, S\&C allows for the tracking of the interview process and provides constructive suggestions for improving project descriptions and CVs. Additionally, it facilitates the management of complaints from universities, enhancing overall communication and collaboration. 

The main goals of the platform are the following:
